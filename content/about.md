## About the QualityDream Lab

The **QualityDream** stands for **Quality** **D**esign for **R**everse **E**ngineering and **A**dditive **M**anufacturing. The overarching goal of Zhaohui's Research Group is *to develop an architecture,  both in establishing the theory and in developing methodology, which provides complete access to spatial data and can execute analytical methodologies to achieve various research and production objectives*.

## About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is *Zhaohui Geng*. I am currently an **Assistant Professor** (tenure-track) in the [Department of Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering](https://www.utrgv.edu/maie/index.htm) at [The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley](https://www.utrgv.edu/en-us/index.htm). I got my **Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering** in 2021 from the [University of Pittsburgh](www.pitt.edu) under the supervision of Dr. [Bopaya Bidanda](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/People/Faculty/Profiles/Bopaya-Bidanda/). I started my life as a graduate student at Pitt in 2014. I also hold a **Master of Arts in Statistics** (2018) and a **Master of Science in Industrial Engineering** (2016) from Pitt. Prior to studying at Pitt, I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Science and Engineering** at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/), China.

## Research Interest

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My major research interests lie in the intersection of **applied statistics** and **advanced manufacturing**. Particular research areas include statistical shape analysis, statistical machine learning, Bayesian data analysis, Bayesian optimization, experimental design, statistical quality control, and large-scale optimization, with applications in reverse engineering, additive manufacturing, metrology, manufacturing systems, product development, healthcare, and service systems. Currently, I have particular interests in developing statistical inferential methodologies and statistical/probabilistic machine learning algorithms to solve quality-related problems at the intersections of design, metrology, advanced manufacturing, and production systems.

Major research topics include:
- Manufacturing systems:
  - Reverse engineering and geometric metrology;
  - Additive manufacturing; and
  - Tolerance modeling and analysis.
- Applied Statistics:
  - Statistical and probabilistic machine learning;
  - Statistical shape analysis and inference;
  - Experimental (optimal) design;
  - Statistical quality monitoring and control; 
  - High-dimensional statistical learning and inference; and
  - Functional data analysis.

Other research topics include:
- Discrete-event simulation:
  - Customizable modeling techniques; and
  - Applications in manufacturing, healthcare, service, and other industries.
- Safety engineering:
  - Intervention effectiveness analysis; and
  - Safety behavioral observation.
